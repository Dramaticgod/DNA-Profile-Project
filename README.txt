This project takes a file with string of DNA STRs and compares it with another file with string of DNA STRs and then compares those two to give out the matches
between the strings.

The numbered files (1.txt, 2.txt, etc), (small.txt), (large.txt) are the DNA STRs file for testing purposes.
Our vector file contains functions that implemented in a data structure that are used in my main.cpp file.
