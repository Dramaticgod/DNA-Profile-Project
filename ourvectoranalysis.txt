<ourvector<ourvector>> stats:
vectors created : 1
 # it is created in line 419 to store vector of vector of strains
elements inserted : 3
# pushing 3 vectors into the double vectors in loadSTRs
elements accessed : 64
# a) elements accessed in display functions to output data to console 
  b) elements accessed in processDna command to compare strings to other strings from DNA vector
c) elements accessed  twice in allStr to compare strings and also display the elements
